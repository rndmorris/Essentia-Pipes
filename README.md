# Essentia Pipes
Do you like Thaumcraft, but find the essentia tube system frustrating? Do you find yourself wishing they behaved
like pipes from every other mod? Have you tried **Essentia Pipes**?

**Essentia Pipes** is an add-on to Thaumcraft 4 that adds a complimentary pipe system. Where normal essentia tubes
require convoluted setups to avoid different types of suction from conflicting with each other, a single line of
**Essentia Pipes** can connect to any number of jars, buffers, reservoirs, and more regardless of what suction types
those blocks are outputting.

## Features
* Three different flavors of **Essentia Pipes**: basic, thaumium, and voidmetal.
* Each comes in default grey, and with seven additional color variants!
* Configurable transfer rates for each type of **Essentia Pipe**.

![Three horizontal lines of essentia pipes are featured, each three blocks long. The topmost line is a plain grey. The middlemost is also grey, with a thaumium purple frame. The bottommost line is again grey, but with a voidmetal dark purple frame.](./.github/images/pipe_flavors.png)

![An array of essentia pipes, seven blocks long and three blocks high, are displayed. The bottommost line of essentia pipes are grey. The remaining pipes are different colors, arranged from left to right: yellow, red, blue, green, white, black, and purple. The colored pipes only connect to pipes of the same color and the grey pipes.](./.github/images/pipe_colors.png)
